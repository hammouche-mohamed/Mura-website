Welcome to **Mura**, an all-in-one, immersive, and gamified language learning platform designed to make mastering a new language fun, social, and effective. Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your fluency, Mura has you covered with interactive tools, intelligent feedback, and a vibrant community of learners.

🏆 This project was created as part of **my first ever hackathon**, where my team earned **2nd place**! I proudly led the team, contributed most of the backend and frontend development, and integrated core features like AI tutoring, video calling, and gamified challenges.
